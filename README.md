# note-takingapp

## Description
This project was fun and a bit complicated at first. However, once I was able to get the first parts working I instantly knew what to do after. My motivation was seeing it working. Therefore, this pushed me to complete the tasks.

Calling the fs functions correctly was challenging and took many trials and console.logs to get to the right structure. However, managing to have all attribute work well was very encouraging.

## Installation
Step 1: Install express and path in terminal - npm i express path

Step 2: Create a server.js file and utilize index.js file as a guide..

Step 3: Work on your GET, POST and finally DELETE functions as they will allow your Note-taking app to generate/function as requested.

Step 4: Run console logs when a code isn't functioning as expected so as to guide you.

Step 5: Use your terminal as a guide and node server.js for results.
